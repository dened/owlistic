**Owlistic** is a Telegram bot written in Dart. It helps users automatically track their Telc exam results by allowing them to register their exam details and receive notifications when their certificates become available.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Automatic Certificate Checking**: Periodically queries the Telc portal for certificate availability for registered users.
-   **Telegram Notifications**: Notifies users via Telegram when their certificate is found or if there's an update on the search status.
-   **User Data Registration**: Allows users to securely save their Telc participant number, birth date, and exam date.
-   **Data Management**: Users can view their registered information and delete specific entries or all their data.
-   **On-Demand Checking**: Provides a `/check_now` command for users to trigger an immediate search for their results.
-   **Separate Lookup Service**: Includes `bin/lookup_service.dart`, a command-line utility for performing certificate lookups. This can be run manually or scheduled (e.g., via cron) for batch processing.
-   **Data Processing Consent**: Implements a consent flow during the `/start` command, requiring users to agree to a privacy policy before their data is stored.
-   **Localization**: Supports multiple interface languages (e.g., English, German, Russian - configurable via `*.arb` files).
-   **SQLite Storage**: Uses an SQLite database for persistent storage of user information, search criteria, and consent status.
-   **Flexible Configuration**: Configurable via command-line arguments or a `.env` file for both the bot and the lookup service.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Docker support can be easily implemented.
-   **Open-Source**: Available under the MIT License (or your chosen license).

## üöÄ Getting Started

The application consists of two main executable components: the Telegram Bot and the Lookup Service.

### üíª Minimum System Requirements

-   **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or a recent Linux distribution.
-   **Processor**: x86_64 or ARM64.
-   **Memory**: 64 MB RAM (128 MB recommended for smoother operation, especially with many users).
-   **Storage**: 50 MB available space (plus space for the SQLite database, which will grow with user data).
-   **Dart SDK**: Version `^3.5.4` or compatible (see `pubspec.yaml` for specific constraints).
-   **Docker**: (Optional) For running the application in a containerized environment.

### üîß Install Dependencies

1.  Ensure you have the Dart SDK installed.
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dened/owlistic.git
    cd owlistic
    ```
3.  Install dependencies and generate necessary files:
    ```sh
    dart pub get
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

**1. Telegram Bot (`bin/owlistic.dart`)**

This script runs the main Telegram bot that users interact with.

*   **Using command-line arguments:**
    ```sh
    dart run bin/owlistic.dart --token="YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN" --privacy-policy-url="https://yourdomain.com/privacy" 
    ```

*   **Using a `.env` file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root (e.g., `owlistic/.env`):
    ```env
    token="YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN"
    privacy-policy-url="https://yourdomain.com/privacy"
    ```
    Then, run the bot:
    ```sh
    dart run bin/owlistic.dart
    ```

**2. Certificate Lookup Service (`bin/lookup_service.dart`)**

This script is designed for periodic execution (e.g., by a cron job) to check for certificates for all registered users or for a specific user. It uses the same configuration mechanisms.

*   **To check for all users:**
    ```sh
    dart run bin/lookup_service.dart --token="YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN" 
    ```
    (Ensure `TOKEN` is provided if notifications are sent directly by this service, or if it needs to interact with bot functionalities that require the token).

*   **To check for a specific user (replace `USER_CHAT_ID`):**
    ```sh
    dart run bin/lookup_service.dart --token="YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN" --chat-id=USER_CHAT_ID --check-days=15
    ```
    The `.env` file will also be read by this script if present.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration can be provided via command-line arguments or a `.env` file located in the project root. Command-line arguments take precedence over `.env` variables.
The application's `Arguments` class determines how environment variables are loaded. Typically, for an option like `--token`, the corresponding environment variable would be `TOKEN`. Please verify with the `Arguments` class implementation if a prefix (e.g., `CONFIG_`) is used.

| Argument                 | Environment Variable (`.env`) Example | Description                                                                                                | Default Value          | Used By         |
